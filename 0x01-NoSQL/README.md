## More Info
- Install MongoDB 4.2 in Ubuntu 18.04: [Official installation guide](#)
- Potential issue if documents creation doesnâ€™t work or this error: Data directory /data/db not found., terminating (source and source)
  - `$ sudo mkdir -p /data/db`
- If `/etc/init.d/mongod` is missing, please find here an example of the file: [Click to expand/hide file contents](#)
- Use "container-on-demand" to run MongoDB
  - Ask for container Ubuntu 18.04 - MongoDB
  - Connect via SSH or via the WebTerminal
  - In the container, you should start MongoDB before playing with it: `$ service mongod start`
- To list databases, run: `$ cat 0-list_databases | mongo`
